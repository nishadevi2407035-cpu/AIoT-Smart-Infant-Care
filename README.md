# AIoT-Enabled Smart Infant Care & Cry Detection System

## Project Overview
AIoT-based smart infant monitoring system that detects baby cries using an intelligent sound sensor, analyzes the cry with AI to identify hunger, discomfort, or sleep disturbance, and sends notifications to caretakers. Multi-level caretaker escalation ensures no alert is missed. 

## Features
- AI-based cry detection & classification
- Smart caretaker alert system with escalation
- Baby care schedule management
- Medicine and feeding reminders
- Multilingual support
- Web & mobile dashboard
- Real-time notifications
- Cloud data storage & history
- Emergency alert mode

## AI Technologies & Hardware
AI: Machine Learning, CNN/RNN, NLP, Rule-based AI  
Hardware: ESP32/ESP8266, Sound sensor, Wi-Fi, Power supply

## Workflow
Baby Cradle -> Sound Sensor -> Microcontroller -> AI Model -> Caretaker Alerts -> Web/Mobile App

## Usage
- Place the sensor near the cradle.  
- System detects cries and sends alerts.  
- Caretaker escalation occurs if primary does not respond.
